# Art151-p5DrawingMachine Version 2

This program is a study on randomness. The grey lines in the background are generated by joining 2 random points on the canvas. On the other hand, when clicking on the screen you can create Perlin Noise generated lines, in which the 2 points are still random, but are related to previous points created.

Clicking: Click and hold anywhere on the canvas to draw perlin lines. (Velocity is determined by mouse x position) RightArrow: Change to next color LeftArrow: Change to previous color
